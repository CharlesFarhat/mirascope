"""
Colocation is the core of our philosophy. Everything that can impact the quality of a
call to an LLM — from the prompt to the model to the temperature — must live together
so that we can properly version and test the quality of our calls over time. This is
useful since we have all of the information including metadata that we could want for
analysis, which is particularly important during rapid development.
